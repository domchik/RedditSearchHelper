# Reddit Search Helper App

An application for searching Reddit posts built with React and Node.js  


## General comments
* Usually I use TypeScript for both React and Node.js projects. I wrote this application in Javascript for the sake of simplicity 
* Unit tests were added only in the backend. In a real project I would also add unit test to the client
* React project was created using Vite 
* .env file was omitted for the sake of simplicity  
* Dockerfile was not added 

## Key Features

* Search Reddit posts by keyword and displays the results containing the fields according to the spec.
* A 3rd party tooltip library was added to show long posts more clearly
* Html sanitation was added in the backend to prevent potentially harmful content 
* Skeleton loader was added for enhanced user experience
